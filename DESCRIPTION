Description: An implementation of an efficient heuristic to compute the nonlinear
    correlations between numeric vectors. The heuristic works by adaptive
    identifying multiple local regions of linear correlations to estimate the
    overall nonlinear correlation. The nonlinear correlations estimate has
    various applications in data exploration and variable selection for
    nonlinear models.
